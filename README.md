# Snaptorio
A mod for making screenshots easier in Factorio

![Snaptorio](http://i.imgur.com/9CPtKgY.png)

Saves screenshots in script-output/Snaptorio directory. Each screenshot gets a unique filename. Pressing the button multiple times will cause multiple images to be stored (rather than just one that gets overwritten).

Can optionally show entity info and set the resolution.

Leaving the resolution blank or entering a non-number into either field causes snaptorio to use default settings.
